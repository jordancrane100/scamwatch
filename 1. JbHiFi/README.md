# Scam #1: SMS from "JbHiFi" about 2nd place in survey-lottery competition

## The Scam
I received a spoofed SMS from the name *JbHiFi* (no number) with the following message:
> Hey! On June 15th you participated in survey-lottery competition. You finished 2nd!. See what you won http://tgogtz.com/fTE Your HifiStore.

Obvious scam. Written badly, weird URL, also I never participated in anything of the sort.
