# Scam #1: SMS from "JbHiFi" about 2nd place in survey-lottery competition

## The Scam
I received a spoofed SMS from the name **JbHiFi** (no number) with the following message:
> Hey! On June 15th you participated in survey-lottery competition. You finished 2nd!. See what you won http://tgogtz.com/fTE Your HifiStore.

Obvious scam. Written badly, weird URL, also I never participated in anything of the sort.

## Investigation

Googled the domain *tgogtz.com* and found no relevant results. Visited the root of the website and saw this landing page:

```Oops! You've reached an invalid link
Please contact the source of the link you just clicked and let them know.

Clearly not legit.

Googled this: `"is a url shortener used by 1,000's of businesses."`.

Google returned at least 200 different websites using the same content. I sorted the results and got this list of domains:

The domain I was directed to (*tgogtz.com*) wasn't in the results, so it's safe to assume that there are many more than the ones returned by my simple search.

Sorted the IPs and ordered by count:

34.227.226.117 - 5
34.74.175.15 - 5

2606:4700:30::681c:1e99 - 1
2606:4700:30::681c:1f99 - 1
```

Most of the websites are using the same IP address but some of them were different. Decided to quickly check what the differences were.

Turns out 4 of the single use IPs:
```
gtcheck.com 192.64.119.153
tiresdownload.com 162.255.119.9
tireslabs.com 192.64.119.78
tirhq.com 192.64.119.84
```
redirect to: `https://abab5qo3y1dw1w6uvasfzu3xbl.hop.clickbank.net/`
which was already blocked by my uMatrix addon for Firefox. I found `clickbank.net` and `hop.clickbank.net` in the list *hpHosts’ Ad and tracking servers* and *MVPS HOSTS*. 
Other lists such as *Dan Pollock’s hosts file* and *Peter Lowe’s Ad and tracking server list* had `clickbank` related blocks, but not the exact one.

One of them was parked, so I'll ignore that:
```
babslt.com 192.64.119.36
```

The rest seem to be the same fake URL shortener website. Even though 2 of those domains have different IPs from the rest, and both have 2 IPv4s and 2 IPv6s for some reason:
```
goherej.com 2606:4700:30::681c:1e99
goherej.com 2606:4700:30::681c:1f99
goherej.com 104.28.30.153
goherej.com 104.28.31.153
fclickit.com 2606:4700:30::6818:647e
fclickit.com 2606:4700:30::6818:657e
fclickit.com 104.24.100.126
fclickit.com 104.24.101.126
```
And none of the URLs which I tried were blocked by any of my blockers.

## Testing the actual URL

I decided to then visit the actual URL I was sent: `http://tgogtz.com/fTE`

It redirected to another domain: `http://track.kiwiclicks.com/7927275c-c5e1-457a-bbd8-395862852a24` with a few different parameters in the URL (which I have stripped from here), including my mobile number.

That site then redirected to another one, with even more parameters: `http://lander1.giveaways-online.com/l15/` (stripped the parameters again)

This is where the content of the scam was.

I decided to not click on anything. But it was clear that the original short URL was just for my number and for the JB HiFi scam, and it was designed for an Australian audience.

Going to a random URL on `http://tgogtz.com/` for example `http://tgogtz.com/example` would just show the same content as the homepage.

But if I changed the URL slightly from `http://tgogtz.com/fTE` to `http://tgogtz.com/fTF` it would successfully redirect to another scam domain with somebody elses phone number as the parameter.

## Testing other URLs

I decided to try one of the other domains I found to see if they were just mirrors or not.

I tried: `http://www.vclickit.com/fTE`

which then redirected to `https://cliq.to/rrj5r`

which then redirected to `https://tracking.patientzerotech.com/955b6e12-fcfa-4316-8781-cb1a6db4aa7a?url_campaign=REPLACE&place=REPLACE`

and finally redirected to `https://horizonsettler.com/crypvipclub_vlm_en/?coc=9373&subc=wQPATGT573HNNASO1LCIV3FQ&paramc=citetest&paramf=955b6e12-fcfa-4316-8781-cb1a6db4aa7a`.

So another domain's shortened URL went through a different set of domains and parameters for a completely different scam. This time a *Crypto VIP Club*:

```
Unleash The Power Of Crypto and Earn $17,000 every week
The System The Banks Don't Want You To Know About!

```

Try another? `http://28az.info/a` redirects to `https://loanify.app/login/?c=14946&source=se-cnv-01.28-la`

Another? `http://poptmm.com/fTE` redirects to `http://tracking.fasteyebd.com/4895eceb-af2f-43cf-84cf-5e224ef64cd5` which rediects to `https://paketinfo.kebigroup.com/?cid=wSJ41TN6931H1KSOHVB17D2A&sub2=SEG3110819SME&lumi2=1`. A site that was in Swedish.

## Intermission

My guess at this point is that these are global scammers with at least hundreds of different scams and these URL shortener domains are just entry points. I could probably find more of them, test some URLs on each, collect the domains each one redirects through and compile a larger list.

For now I'll see if there's any information about who is hosting these sites and who owns these domains. I know that the majority will have private WHOIS records and most likely be hosted in places which either don't care or are unaware of their customers actions.

So my main goal would probably just be to compile a list of domains for blocklists to add.

## Clickbank

I was interested in the clickbank redirects from those few domains earlier and thought it might have some answers. I googled clickbank and found that it is allegedly something legitimate. An *affiliate marketing program*. Seems like something people use to try and get rich quick online. The main domain is `clickbank.com` but `clickbank.net` also redirects to it. I am going to assume the Clickbank people have nothing to do with these other scammers and one of them just decided to redirect a few domains to their Clickbank URL for clicks? They must get something out of it. But the fact that clickbank domains were on some of the blocklists I use makes me think it isn't something that great either. But I'll consider it unrelated to these scammers.

## Domains

The majority of the URL shortener domains are registered at Namecheap and have Whoisguard protection so that information is protected.

## IPs

The main IP address used by the domains `89.248.172.46` belongs to an IP range owned by network provider [`Ip Volume Inc`](http://www.ipvolume.net/) in the country Seychelles.

`34.227.226.117` belongs to Amazon EC2.

`34.74.175.15` belongs to Google Cloud.

`68.183.21.244` belongs to DigitalOcean.

The IP addresses of those 2 peculiar domains which were set up differently are all on Cloudflare:
```104.24.100.126
104.24.101.126
104.28.30.153
104.28.31.153
2606:4700:30::6818:647e
2606:4700:30::6818:657e
2606:4700:30::681c:1e99
2606:4700:30::681c:1f99
```

The other individual use IPs are part of Namecheap Hosting:
```
192.64.119.153
162.255.119.9
192.64.119.78
192.64.119.84
```

I think it's quite normal for cloud providers to be abused by spammers and scammers. The Seychelles one interests me since it hosts the majority of the domains and also I'd never heard of that country before lol. Also why are the domains spread out so unevenly across different networks?
