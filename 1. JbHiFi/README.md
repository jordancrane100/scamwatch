# Scam #1: SMS from "JbHiFi" about 2nd place in survey-lottery competition

## The Scam
I received a spoofed SMS from the name **JbHiFi** (no number) with the following message:
> Hey! On June 15th you participated in survey-lottery competition. You finished 2nd!. See what you won http://tgogtz.com/fTE Your HifiStore.

Obvious scam. Written badly, weird URL, also I never participated in anything of the sort.

## Investigation

Googled the domain *tgogtz.com* and found no relevant results. Visited the root of the website and saw this landing page:

```Oops! You've reached an invalid link

Clearly not legit.

Googled this: `"is a url shortener used by 1,000's of businesses."`.

Google returned at least 200 different domains using the same content. I sorted the results and got this:

The domain I was directed to (*tgogtz.com*) wasn't in the results, so it's safe to assume that there are many more than the ones returned by my simple search.
